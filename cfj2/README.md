# Clojure from Java 2

Example on how to run clojure functions from Java.

## Design

Code in Java wants to access a clojure functions.

Design decisions for this example:
* Java and Clojure code in same project
* Using gen-class to generate java class from clojure
    * compile clojure function into a normal class

## Usage

`lein run`

or `lein uberjar` and than `java -jar cfj2-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

## How it is done

* Clojure code is in `cfj/uppercaser.clj`
* Java code is in `uppercaser/Main.java`

Clojure code is AOTed (compiled ahead of time) in order to generate java classes. There classes are then used from java code. As calling clojure code from java is nonstandard for leiningen, we have to reverse the compilation in leiningen, so that clojure code is AOTed before java class is compiled.

In `project.clj`
* Specify paths for java and clojure code
* reverse compilation in :prep-tasks
* specify what to AOT in :aot
